Basics
======

A Hard Rock-solid Theme based on HTML5 Boilerplate «For Those About to Rock» with WordPress

BLANK THEME: 
	https://github.com/br1o/basics
	As you can see it by yourself, Basics is not supposed to be used "as is". You could fill the css/author.css file in order to give your blog its own style. Or you can use a "Child theme".

CHILD THEME: 
	https://github.com/br1o/beyond-basics
	I recommand you to use a Child Theme - like Beyond Basics - to create your website from the theme "Basics" in order to easier the work brought by the updates that I'll make in the futur. Read the README.txt file of Beyond Basics for more informations.
